# Shape-Shift

Learning to use OpenGL by implementing a paddle ball game that breaks shapes. Shapes were setup using vertices, vertex shaders, fragment shaders, vertex array objects (VAO), vertex buffer objects (VBO), element buffer objects (EBO), as well as model, view, and projection matrices. Lots of model matrices were used for translating shapes throughout the game.

Game logic includes collision detection when a ball hits the paddle, keyboard input for moving the paddle up and down to hit the ball, velocity vectors for the ball, as well as positioning and speed for all shapes to determine collision detections and rendering objects.
